### Spring Web Application

___

Simple **web application** built on the __Spring Framework__
The application is based on the fact that it is a digital library where you can add, modify, read and delete both people and books (i.e. perform all crud operations). 
There is also the functionality of assigning a book to a specific user. 
The relationship is one-to-many, because only one single book can belong to one user, and a user can have several books.
